    	<p>A 3D artist is a creative professional who designs and builds three-dimensional digital visuals using specialized software. They bring concepts to life by modeling characters, environments, and objects, then adding textures, lighting, and animation to create realistic or stylized scenes. Whether working in games, film, advertising, or product design, a 3D artist blends technical skill with imagination to craft immersive visual experiences.</p>
